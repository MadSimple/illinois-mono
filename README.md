# Jesse Mono
Early release of a monospace font based on [Lexend](https://lexend.com).

![dark_](https://github.com/MadSimple/jesse-mono/assets/92187165/5fed6e8a-5a3d-4f08-8a16-9db7163b2345)

![light](https://github.com/MadSimple/jesse-mono/assets/92187165/511b3ffa-ec37-4696-afb2-0f83cda07fd6)

Glyphs for Latin characters and common symbols are based on Lexend.
The remaining characters use [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono) as a fallback.

Notable changes from Lexend include a double-storey 'a' to distinguish from the 'o', and a '1' without the bottom serif to distinguish it from the lowercase L used by some fonts.

Other changes are due to monospace constraints or personal preference.
