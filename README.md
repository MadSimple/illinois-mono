# Illinois Mono
Early release of a monospace font based on [Lexend](https://lexend.com), a font known for readability.

([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIm8arSogvY) is a video explaining how Lexend increases reading speed)

Glyphs for Latin characters and common symbols are based on Lexend.
The remaining characters currently use [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono) as a fallback.

Notable changes from Lexend include:
* Double-storey 'a' to distinguish from the 'o'
* '1' without bottom serif, to distinguish it from the lowercase L used by some fonts

Most other changes are to fit monospace style.
