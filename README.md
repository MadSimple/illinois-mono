Glyphs for Latin characters and common symbols are based on Lexend.
Other characters currently use [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono) as a fallback.

Notable changes from Lexend include:
* Double-storey 'a' to distinguish from the 'o'
* '1' without bottom serif, to distinguish it from the lowercase L used by some fonts

Most other changes are to fit monospace style.
